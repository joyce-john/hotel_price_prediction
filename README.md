The aim of this project is to predict prices for hotels in Europe using only basic information gathered from public sources. It explores the performance of a few different models and the major points of error. It uses the hotels-europe data prepared by Gábor Békés and Gabor Kezdi, available [here](https://osf.io/r6uqb/).
